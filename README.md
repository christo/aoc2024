# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions to the AOC 2024 programming competition.

Code is in Scala because I am feeling rusty in it.

Build uses `sbt` with the following commands: 

* list programs: `sbt listDays`
* run day01: `sbt day01`, same for day02 etc.
* run all days: `sbt runAll`
* run all available tests (not all days have tests): `sbt test`
